# Recursive Tree / [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-c0gknmnWM)

I played around with this project to learn more about recursion. Make sure to check out the tutorial if you want to learn the basics!

If you're interested in running the code on your own, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module to run the .pyde file. Try playing with some of the variables at the top of the script to get a feel for how they affect the terrain generation.

Feel free to email me at thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
